Code used to perform Dispersion Scan (D-Scan) on ultrafast CPA laser system.

Moves stages to set increments and measures Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) spectrum. Must capture a background and fundamental spectrum first.

Calculation of pulse characteristics is done by genetic algorithm - starts with a reasonable pulse and modifies different orders of chirp to match dscan output.
